### Conformal Prediction on Industrial Manufacturing and AI-Enabled Robotics

Note: this is more about explainability and safety for robotics-enabled AI, and I may include wider topics like: 
* Uncertainty quantification and estimation
    * Softmax-based measures (entropy of softmax scores, max value)
    * “Self”-estimation (model predicts its own confidence scores)
    * Separate independent evaluator (a separate model evaluates the prediction)
    * Model-inherent measures (Bayesian modeling, sampling-based estimates)

Exploration of use cases including:
* Container volume prediction
* Injection molding weight variation prediction
* Manual operation times
* NASA C-MAPSS Turbofan Jet Engine predictive maintenance
* Robotics 3D object detection
* Robotic planning agents that ask for help
* Uncertainty of dynamics models in safety-critical robotics applications
Using packages such as 
* Mapie
* Crepes
